# Laptop-Price-Predictor-Model
This project is related to predict the price of Laptops based on their features. This is a Machine Learning Project where  i used python for building the model.
Building a laptop price prediction model involves several steps, from data collection and preprocessing to model selection and evaluation. I'll provide you with a Python code outline along with descriptions for each step. I used various models like linear regression, KNN Classifier, Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest for this, but keep in mind that more complex models might yield better results in practice.
# Here's a breakdown of the steps:
Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing information about laptops and their prices.

Data Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features (if any), and performing feature scaling or normalization if required.

Splitting the Data: Split the dataset into a training set and a testing set. This allows you to train the model on one part of the data and evaluate its performance on another.

Building the Model: Create a machine learning model. In this example, we used various type of model like linear regression model, KNN Classifier, Decision Tree, SVM, and Random Forest.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) are common metrics for regression problems.

Visualization (Optional): Visualize the model's predictions against the actual prices to gain insights into its performance.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict prices for new laptops by providing their features.
Remember that the success of your model greatly depends on the quality of your dataset and the choice of the model. You may need to explore more advanced techniques, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.
